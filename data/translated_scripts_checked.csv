0," A country of engineers and inventors is being slowed down by bans. No combustion engines, no oil and gas heating. We say no more ideological experiments. The AfD is committed to genuine technological openness, to research instead of paternalism. Progress comes from a diversity of ideas, not from green regulations. And not through bans. We are turning Germany back into a country of innovation. Therefore, on February 23, vote for Alternative for Germany."
1," The completely uncontrolled, illegal, mass immigration. People are still pouring into our country by the hundreds of thousands. We can no longer cope with that. That's why we voted AfD on February 23."
2," Friedrich Merz took the influx limitation law, which had just been rejected, off the agenda in December for fear of random majorities. You have to imagine that. If we had been able to pass it, there might not have been one or two deaths."
3, Can you still remember that? Agnes Strack-Zimmermann? Let her go. Robert Habeck also wants war. Please let him go himself. Ms. Baerbock wants war. Please let her go. These responsible decision-makers and politicians should go themselves.
4," Welcome to the big AfD clique calendar. Today. Nancy keeps everyone here. Nancy, did you hear that Syria has been liberated? Yes, I heard that. My Syrians are staying here anyway. Yes, but they could go back to their home country now, Nancy. No, my Syrians are staying here forever. Yes, but they no longer have a reason to flee. Shouldn't they be helping to rebuild their home country? I said they're staying here. If you ask again, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is watching you. And what should the people who want the Syrians to return home do? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
5," Welcome to the AfD's big clique calendar. Today it's Karlchen and his salmon fish. Well Karlchen, what are you having for Christmas Eve? Fish, salmon fish and spinach and other fishy-fiegetic dishes. Oh, that sounds like a healthy meal, Karl. Yes, it is. I don't eat salmon fish that isn't double-vaccinated and triple-boosted. And what should the citizens do who can no longer stand this chanting and your drivel about vaccination? They should vote for the AfD. You just can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode. See you next time. See you next time."
6," We don't really need to introduce her anymore, but because it's so nice. She studied economics and business administration, graduated Magna Cum Laude and worked for various well-known large companies. She joined the AfD in 2013 and is already our Chancellor of Hearts. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our candidate for Chancellor. This is Alice Weidel. ZDF subtitling, 2020 I love you! All of you! I joined the AfD because I knew that the euro would not last. But I would never have dreamed that the country would slide so far within ten years. With coercion and bans in all kinds of areas, this ampeleinheitspartei, which the CDU/CSU parties are also moving ever closer to, it's almost indistinguishable, wanted to turn the citizens into subjects. And my personal motivation in politics in such situations has always been my orientation towards freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, freedom of the press, to preserve all these freedoms. And I believe that must also be the goal in this election campaign. You are a fighter. With your example, you inspire and motivate more and more people to join the AfD and rally behind the AfD. And you resolutely confront the opponents of freedom with your razor-sharp intellect. I hope that the AfD does well and that Alice Biedel now becomes a Chancellor. I think that would be very good for Germany. If you are the Future Future, you have to make it good and fight for it to be good. That's how it will be good. We will set the course for freedom and relieve the burden on citizens and companies. That is our credo. We want foreign companies to settle in Germany again. We want to make Germany strong and rich again. We want Germany back in Germany back in Germany back in Germany. Once again, an appeal to all of you. Go from door to door. Convince your families, your friends. Convince the people. The Alternative for Germany is there to protect this country and make it great and proud again. Dear friends, let's fight for this together. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
7," Trump ran an election campaign with lies, hatred and agitation like we've never seen before. Is he also a role model for you in this respect? Do you want to intensify death in the future? So now you're asking me about hatred and incitement, i.e. all the rhetoric you've used against Donald Trump. And let me say one thing. Donald Trump won these elections precisely because of the hatred and incitement, because of the disparagement from abroad by the mainstream media, because people are no longer being taken for fools. All this Wokelinke nonsense, which is also supported by the mainstream media, people are no longer prepared to put up with it. And above all, young people voted for Donald Trump. Why? Because they want to be educated properly and no longer want to be taught all this woke left-wing gender nonsense, but want real prospects for the future with a proper education system. And that's exactly what's wrong with the Federal Republic of Germany. I will tell you, I will tell you what happens when the AfD is in government. They will throw all this gender nonsense out of the education plan and give the young people in this country, the working population, prospects."
8," Because this policy, which we want, would lead to Europe becoming strong again, with strong leadership. And the leadership would not be left to the unelected Commission. It is not von der Leyen. She has no mandate at all. She is not even elected. The competencies, the sovereignty, the decisions must lie with the elected national parliaments. And that requires strong, self-confident, rich nations."
9," I have the impression that this policy is being conducted against its own people. Everyone who drives to work in the morning, raises a family and pays their taxes is also being completely ripped off by this government. And also the many pensioners. It can't be right that people who have paid into the pension fund for decades are now going out to collect bottles. 25 percent of pensioners are on basic benefits with less than 1000 euros. That is something that I find irresponsible. And as soon as the AfD is in government, we will put an end to this course."
10," It's great that I take the oath of office in my election commercial. I can't understand why some in my party call me an ice princess, I'm super nice. I certainly learned nothing from Angela Merkel. My biggest mistake? I'd even have to think about that. What was my biggest mistake? Well, maybe they'll get to it. Maybe I'll get to it later. Next half-sentence, that I'm a feminist. Oh, that I'm a feminist, I wouldn't call myself that. What if Robert Habeck were to invite me to the kitchen table? That would be quite amusing. If Donald Trump were to receive me in the White House soon? That would be interesting too. That would be pretty pero that I'm here all in the kitchen nonsense Clayton medo. So that would be favorable congratulations. That would be nothing happened. I am myself to me that is book colored. As Milan up in the kitchen from slammed me must join,"
11," We need a Fortress Europe that must be protected. We need naval operations to force these ships with the smugglers and criminals to return. And as a consequence of Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, there is a threat of a further influx of refugees from Gaza and the Middle East. As the AfD parliamentary group, we are demanding a clear statement from the Chancellery that Germany will no longer accept migrants from Gaza and the Middle East."
12," I can tell you, and with this I would also like to ring in the new year 2025, that we as Alternative for Germany have set out to return to freedom in this country, that everyone is free to express their opinion."
13," So, now it's quiet. So, if I wasn't a public figure, I would totally love to go dancing again spontaneously, go out, listen to loud music, do stupid things, even do stupid things. If I wasn't a public figure, I would absolutely love to spontaneously go to a club again, jump around, behave stupidly without having to think that videos are being made, like now, I have to sit down. Then I would definitely, if I wasn't a public figure and didn't have the job I have, I would definitely not spend weekends at party conferences like this. That's how it starts. Then I would also love to go dancing spontaneously again, go out, listen to loud music, do stupid things, even stupid things, without being afraid or having any concerns. I'm not afraid of having concerns about it being in the next tabloid anyway. So, I'm an extremely freedom-loving person and I can only tell you all that if you have the opportunity, enjoy your life and your freedom and get the most out of it. My favorite food, well, there is no one favorite food, so I like to cook Indian and Thai food, I love to eat Thai food. For example, there's the papaya salad, which I like to eat, then there's the beef salad, the labgai, that's what it's called. And yes, I also love to eat a plate of spaghetti with a well-made tomato sauce when I make it. And yes. I think I've been doing that for years. No, I'm joking. Because I do some free speeches, but a presentation. I think I could say quite a lot about history. But that would bore everyone. Then I think I could talk a lot about health and nutrition, because I think that's cool and exciting. Yes, and about music, I think that would also be really cool. By the way, I used to produce music on the computer during my studies. I also had my music program, I did a lot of drum bass stuff. I could tell you a bit more about that, but I think I'm a bit out of time now, because I'm old and I used to do all that stuff when I was young. No, I didn't have a DJ name. I think I'm more of a winter person. Although I also like it warm. But winter is so cozy. The best thing about my job is that I can meet and get to know incredibly interesting and committed people from all backgrounds. I wouldn't have been able to do that before. Whether I'm a fan of someone myself is an interesting question. Am I a fan of someone? I once said that I was a big fan of Margaret Thatcher. I thought she was a great woman. She was funny. She had a great sense of humor and got a lot of things right. I'm not the type to say I'm going to send the aircraft carriers out to say that the Falklands are British. Not like that. But she was incredibly assertive and acted according to her convictions against all odds. And yes, I'm not generally a fan of, well, I don't think I am here. But maybe I would ask him for a selfie. I once asked Ai Weiwei for a selfie. He also distanced himself from me afterwards. He's this Chinese artist. I think he'd be great. Right, and I'll leave it at that now before I talk to you about it. See you next time."
14," Dear fellow citizens, the murderous mass attack by an Afghan asylum seeker on kindergarten children in Aschaffenburg has shaken and awakened our country and its people. A two-year-old brutally murdered, a girl of the same age seriously injured. A hero who stood in front of the attacked children and gave his life for them. Another man who bravely stood up to the murderer and suffered extremely serious injuries. It is a horrific crime, but it is not an isolated case. Every day in Germany, people are attacked with knives, beaten up or killed, sexually harassed, humiliated or raped, threatened, robbed and humiliated. It affects young and old, women and children, people with or without a migration background, in East and West, day and night, on city streets or in the provinces. And time and time again, the perpetrators are said to be rejected asylum seekers from the notorious main countries of origin, obliged to leave the country and known to the police because of their long criminal records. In other words, people who should never have come to this country or should have been sent home long ago. The Islamist attacks in Mannheim and Solingen, the car massacre by an Arab at the Magdeburg Christmas market, the bloodbath in Aschaffenburg and all the countless attacks and acts of violence that don't make it into the mainstream news. Enough is enough. And it's been far too long, far too long, far too much. After ten years of politically motivated loss of control in migration policy, set in motion by CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel and taken to extremes by the green-red traffic light, people in this country have reached the end of their patience. Whether they are native citizens or law-abiding foreign nationals, they no longer want to have to ask themselves, who will be hit next? My family, my children or myself? They don't want to hear any more phrases, embellishments and excuses. No more one-off alibi deportation flights just before elections and no more ritual demonstrations against the right by cynical, left-wing, green lobbyists. They want the state and the authorities to do their duty to the taxpayers who owe them money and to fulfill their most important task of protecting citizens and ensuring compliance with the law. In a word, they want the migration turnaround. The time for this has now come. The leader of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Friedrich Merz, apparently also understood this in a moment of insight when he presented his five-point program, copied from the AfD parliamentary group's long-standing demands, and declared in response to my offer of cooperation that he did not care how the majorities for the necessary resolutions would come about. This shows the only realistic path to a change in migration policy. The undemocratic firewall that disregards the will of the voters must finally come down and the majorities that correspond to the unanimous desire of citizens for a safe homeland must be used. If the CDU/CSU submits sensible and serious draft legislation, the AfD parliamentary group will not withhold its consent. That is how we have always seen it. The welfare of the country and its citizens must take precedence over ideological dogmatism and selfish party tactics. I do not hope that the CDU/CSU resolution circulating on the Internet is Friedrich Merz's last word on the terrible murders in Aschaffenburg. The fact that the CDU/CSU misused the justification for its motion to attack the AfD after the horrific, murderous knife attack by an Afghan on small children is disturbing and shows that it has still not recognized the signs of the times. We don't want to have to mourn any more dead children. The AfD has therefore reached out. Now the CDU and CSU must also deliver with the necessary seriousness. A non-binding motion for a resolution, such as the one now on the table, is not yet a turnaround on migration. This requires concrete and binding laws. The CDU/CSU is free at any time to agree to our targeted initiatives or to put its own targeted initiatives and laws to the vote immediately. Friedrich Merz will have to decide whether he has the courage to tear down the firewall and contribute to a genuine change in migration policy. Or will he continue to hide behind the ruins of this anti-democratic dogma that the green-left should retain power even without a majority? If Friedrich Merz continues to curry favour with those forces who, in self-righteous contempt for the victims, rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend, which also marked the second anniversary of the murder of two young people in Brockstedt, in favour of continuing with mass migration and the task of control, who celebrate with smiling demo selfies while families in Aschaffenburg mourn the victims of brutal migrant violence, then there will be more firewall deaths whose blood will also be on the hands of a Union leadership that refuses to accept the necessary change. The AfD will remain true to its course and keep its promise. We will continue to fight for majorities for a policy that makes Germany safe again. Because there will only be a real turnaround in migration with the AfD. The whole thing again barely respects the D abnormal an energy in the妈zna hydrate of Leibhü diagram after the Checkmat one on."
15," Welcome to the AfD's calendar. Today, Robert's lights are going out. Can you explain to the audience what the better tree lighting law should be, Robert? Yes, with pleasure. With the better tree lighting law, we want to reduce CO2 emissions to zero during the winter festival. That's why the lights on the tree of lights may only be lit between 5.55 am and 6 am. That's only 5 minutes a day. How is there supposed to be a Christmas party? What's the point of asking? We have spent the last two years making people so poor that they can no longer afford to buy presents. And what are these poor people supposed to do after two years of traffic lights? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
16," Do you seriously believe, Mr. Merz, that you could fool the citizens into thinking that anything would be better with them if you continue to curry favour with the Greens and the SPD and commit to forming a coalition with these parties? This is precisely what their dogma of the undemocratic firewall, which is not provided for in the Basic Law, amounts to. The so-called firewall is nothing more than an anti-democratic cartel agreement to undermine the will of the voters and exclude millions of voters."
17," Who will take responsibility for depriving our children of an education and instead filling them with ideology, gender and drag queens and turning them into idiots? Therefore, on February 23, AfD."
18," Our living space is not actually scarce. It's just that millions of people looking for housing have been added to it since 2015. Housing is becoming more and more expensive because the government is adding more and more migrants to the real estate market. This is massively exacerbating the housing shortage. We will ensure that rents fall by freeing up the housing market and enabling many more homes to be built. We will achieve this by drastically reducing the numerous globally unique building standards that have made building in Germany unaffordable to date. At the same time, we are reducing demand. Less uncontrolled migration into the country means less pressure on the housing market. Supply and demand. On February 23, both votes for the Alternative for Germany for affordable rents and real housing. Otherwise Zvereigns Otherwise Zvereigns Otherwise Zareigns Otherwise Zvereigns Otherwise Zvereigns Otherwise Zemeh Otherwise Zareigns"
19," We have a majority for black-blue and that is the will of the voters and that has not just been the case since today. That is the case in the eastern German states, it was the case in Hesse and it is the case in Bavaria. The voters want to have bourgeois majorities in this country. They no longer want these chaotic conditions. Mr. Kistler, he simply wants his children to have a good education, to be able to walk safely on the streets, to be able to use public transport safely and so on. He wants the next generation to be able to start families, to be able to buy a house, to have security and not these chaotic conditions. I mean, our country was completely unhinged by the Green Chancellor Angela Merkel and the CDU. And that is also the reason why we now have these bourgeois majorities. We want to change it, Friedrich Merz obviously doesn't, because otherwise he would say, yes, I'd like to have a chat with Alice Weidel or Tino Chrupalla, let's sound them out. Nothing. And I have to tell you one thing, and that also speaks volumes for the character of Friedrich Merz, the man doesn't even say hello to me when he sees me. And then I think to myself, my God, what kind of schooling, what kind of upbringing have they had? You don't actually do that. But you don't do that. You don't actually do that. I think my upbringing is now the subject of a true name and this brother. Now we also have to go forwardывайтесь and if we can, if we can, because it's notrik外 until we are soampadern, there is in the Am partial.

20," Dear friends, another election year lies ahead of us in which a decisive course will be set for our future and the future of our country. In seven weeks, the German Bundestag will be newly elected. It is not simply a question of giving a run-down and failed government the receipt it deserves. There is more at stake. On 23 February, it will be decided whether this country still has a chance to free itself from the downward spiral of inflation, deindustrialization, mass migration, tax plundering, job destruction and the threat of war into which the irresponsible policies of all the established parties have plunged us. The citizens of this country are pinning their hopes on us. The other parties, which have caused this most serious crisis in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, are not really prepared to correct their wrong decisions. They want to continue to run up debts and raise taxes, burn billions and billions on climate ideology and an eco-socialist planned economy, let hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country uncontrolled year after year and not send anyone back, bully and patronize citizens and shut them up, supply weapons to war zones and ignite the threat of a third world war. It will be a tough election campaign and it will also get ugly. Our opponents know that we will not just make empty promises, but will also get serious if we get into government. They will use unfair means to defend their firewall, their blockade, which they use to secure their dwindling power against a better alternative. They will not play by the rules, invent new defamation campaigns, use the politically instrumentalized domestic secret service even more unscrupulously against us and use all kinds of dirty methods against us. But despite all this, they will not succeed in pushing us back. We will succeed because we have the better arguments. And we will prevail if we stand together, fight for our cause and don't allow anyone or anything to box us in. We stand for a policy of realism and reason, of freedom and the rule of law, of security for all citizens. We stand for the preservation of the foundations of our prosperity and the defense of our national identity. As your candidate for Chancellor, I promise you that I will do everything in my power to ensure that, strengthened by the festive season spent with our families and friends, we will tackle the challenges that lie ahead of us together with courage and confidence. Together, we will manage to turn this country upside down again. I wish you, all of us and our country a happy and prosperous new year 2025. I wish you, all of us and our country a happy and prosperous 2020."
21," I swear that I will devote my strength to the welfare of the German people, increase its benefits, avert harm from it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, conscientiously fulfill my duties and do justice to everyone. So help me God. So help me God."
22," What kind of pathetic understanding of democracy is this? As if the dead children didn't exist, party political games are being put above the lives of innocent citizens. You really can't do anything with this Union. You copied the five-point plan you are presenting today from us. As you know, a non-binding motion for a resolution is by no means a turnaround on migration. You have a method of writing people off instead of deporting them. Because wherever you are in government, whether in Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony-Anhalt, Baden-Württemberg or Schleswig-Holstein, the deportation record is just as miserable or even worse than in the SPD-governed federal states."
23," Every day, the CDU and CSU are killing people senselessly in Ukraine, thousands of stabbers and social system destroyers are crossing Germany's borders. And I can tell you that the next knife murder will be on the Union's ticket. What we want is clear. We want to bear parliamentary responsibility. We want to table and vote on sensible motions here. And we want this Bundestag to be able to work. We have formulated this over and over again here in the rounds. And the CDU/CSU is falling into our arms here and preventing us from doing so, preventing the people of this country from finally seeing solutions. That is pure hypocrisy, irresponsible and dubious."
24," Welcome to the big AfD clique calendar. Today Friedrich has a heavy load to carry. Friedrich, what's wrong with you? Why are you so out of breath? Hello Santa Claus. I'm appearing as Santa Claus at the CDU Christmas party today and my bag is pretty full, yes. Oh, but a few presents can't be that heavy. What's in there? It's actually just stones. But why are you giving away stones, Friedrich? Well, for the cracks in the firewall. Every CDU member gets a brick to repair the firewall. And what should the citizens do who no longer want to look at Friedrich's undemocratic firewall? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
25," I would expect Chancellor Scholz not to make a government statement tomorrow, but to announce his resignation. The way must be cleared for new elections. This government has run its course and is governing against the majority of the population. Two thirds of the people no longer want the traffic light government."
26," It would be a country in which the freedom of citizens is not just lip service, but is at the heart of the legal system and values. Madam President, these interjections. Well, you can say that to your own group, the permanent groups. Your job, Madam President, is to lead a neutral presidency. And this drooling is really getting on your nerves. It is really tiresome. And these people have no place here in the Bundestag. They have never worked a day in their lives. They have never worked here in their lives. That's what you're doing here. We want a country in which fundamental rights, the rights of the individual to defend themselves, go right back to that. Go to work. You will have the opportunity to do so from the week after next, if you are further decimated. Go to work. Look for a job. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
27," For me, Angela Merkel is the first green chancellor our country has had. I want the opposite. I want freedom. I want a free, rich Germany, a prosperous Germany, a sovereign country that has good relations with its neighbors and good relations with the East. That is our most important task. And that includes putting our own country, as the largest country in Europe, back on its feet and in order."
28," He is the stupid one and no longer works for himself and his family, but for cashiers from all over the world. 62 percent of families receiving the citizen's allowance do not have a German passport. Their citizen's income is a fraudulent label. It is migrant money, an immigration magnet."
29," Green-Red has failed. The people have had enough of the ideological transformation of left-green sectarians who have kept them in government here. But you too, Mr. Merz, have already failed, because what you are doing is deceiving voters. You will not be able to implement any of your promises with the Green-Red coalition. That is part of the truth."
30," After the shock news for our economy, the shock news from Friedrich Merz last night. You know, who does it is a secondary question. The decisive factor is what we write down in a possible coalition agreement. And we need a change of policy in Germany, especially when it comes to economic policy. With Habeck or without Habeck. That's for Habeck to decide, if he's still there. He can imagine Robert Habeck, our Minister of Deindustrialization, as Minister of Economics in his coalition next year. And so we know quite clearly that anyone who votes for Friedrich Merz and his CDU is voting for a ""business as usual"" with a black-green coalition."
31," Reactivation of nuclear power. Re-introduction of coal power. Abolish the CO2 tax. Abolish the solidarity surcharge. Lay off workers and companies. Reduce taxes and levies. Lower energy taxes. All this should be done. Let's move on to the migration crisis. The borders must be closed. They need to be controlled. Where is that? We would be ready. But all that is being proclaimed here is a standstill and the meeting is suspended. How are we supposed to continue here, according to the CDU? Should we suspend the session here, parliamentary business, for three months until the new election? That is not our approach. That is not the Alternative for Germany's approach. We have the majority for these sensible proposals, which, incidentally, the CDU is copying from the AfD and obviously never wants to implement. And that's why every vote for the Alternative for Germany counts. We must make the AfD strong for a bourgeois majority in the German parliament. We have to move away from stagnation. We must move towards a bourgeois, sensible policy. And we are ready for that. язы abnormal substances And that, all of a sudden spier... Here we have focused on the Unde here. It's about keeping it ethical. We also need to position theyy launch here. And for that you make quarters for Germany countdown goes. Where we have with it also in this minute 같은mal with Florengator beats you can take over here to Banco pro on. It's about and bes cieläcke."
32," People have the feeling that they have scissors in their heads and that they can no longer say what they really think. And Germany should start articulating its own interests. That is our task. I don't know what Ms. Baerbock was doing anywhere in Indonesia, but we have no business there. We have our security interests here. The CDU is currently campaigning with AfD positions. How are voters, to put it bluntly, being lied to by the CDU? No, I am absolutely against inheritance tax. If the state can't handle our money, the taxpayers' money, which incidentally already has record tax revenues, if it can't handle it, then please don't invent any more tax rates, as it is already doing anyway, via the CO2 levy, then there's more to come, then it should tighten its belt even more. And what does this state offer its own population? It offers its own population eroding internal security, unprotected borders, a dilapidated infrastructure etc. pp. and the world's highest energy prices."
33," Germany will soon be history as an attractive business location if we do not restore the future viability of our country. And we as the AfD have a very clear idea about this. We have a very clear idea of what we will do in our first 100 days in government. We will set the course for freedom and ease the burden on citizens and companies. That is our credo. We want freedom. We want to reduce income tax. We want family splitting. Above all, we want to ease the burden on families and future generations."
34," Citizens have to contend with rising prices, electricity shortages and environmental destruction. Whole forests are being cut down again for inefficient, ugly wind turbines. The AfD puts an end to this madness. No more subsidies for inefficient climate projects, no more EEG levy, no more ideological taxes. We will make energy affordable again and secure Germany's supply. An end to dependency and uncertainty. Therefore, on February 23, vote Alternative for Germany with both your votes."
35," German missiles in Ukraine, which can reach Moscow and include the deployment of German soldiers to operate them, make Germany a direct party to the war and the target of an impending nuclear war. Ms. Baerbock fantasizes about deploying German troops in Ukraine, while Mr. Merz wants to risk a third world war by supplying Taurus cruise missiles."
36," Make outdoor pools safe at last! On 9.6. AfD-Bähen, Blaustadt-Bund."
37," The situation is catastrophic, and our election manifesto and our basic program give top priority to women's work-life balance and family life. What we say quite clearly is that we would not have the problem you have just described at all. First of all, childcare fees must be paid by the state. So, the state obviously has enough money, then it has to take on more if we have too few daycare places. That's where it starts. If we have too few specialist staff, as you have just described, they have to step in, then these specialists and teachers must be paid significantly better."
38, They are preventing political change. They are in favor of business as usual. And that is part of the truth. You first dismantled the left-wing party. Now you're scratching at the 5 percent hurdle. Perhaps you're already regretting the fact that you're both out. I think it was a strategic mistake because you don't stand for political change. And that is now coming out. And that's why you're plummeting.
39," Friends, I repeat, we want something to finally change in our country and that we can finally live in safety again, that we never again have to mourn with a mother who has lost her son in such a senseless and brutal way. Amen."
40, I can promise one thing that we as the AfD will not allow such people to remain in office. That's how it looks. It's a disgrace. That's why AfD on February 23.
41," Broadcasting fees would be abolished. Tax money would be collected sparingly in this country. A good government respects what its citizens have worked hard to earn and does not claim more of it than is absolutely necessary to fulfill its few core tasks. A good government respects the property of its citizens and does not encroach on it with taxes on wealth, inheritance and excessive taxes on income, companies and consumption. A well-governed state does not patronize its citizens. It does not distribute their money all over the world or to ideological lobby groups and favorites in order to buy their allegiance."
42," The courageous police officer Ruben L. lost his life while trying to protect citizens who wanted to exercise their fundamental right to freedom of expression. Our sincere condolences go out to the relatives of Ruben L. at this difficult time. We wish them much strength and Mr. Stürzenberger and the other victims of the brutal knife attack in Mannheim a speedy recovery. The AfD parliamentary group has requested a minute's silence from the Federal President for the police officer who was killed. This murder attack takes imported violence to a new level. It is frankly a disgrace that the political leaders in this country have nothing more than dry compulsory exercises and hackneyed phrases to offer. Federal President Steinmeier reaches a new peak of tastelessness when he takes the Mannheim knife murder as an opportunity to warn against, and I quote, the brutalization of political debate and the growing propensity for violence in our country. I have to say that an Islamist terrorist attack is not a political dispute. And it is also sheer mockery for the citizens who have to suffer from the loss of security in public spaces caused by mass migration. The same applies to Green Party leader Ricarda Lang's equation of the riots on Sylt with the attack in Mannheim. Both are equally a threat to freedom, claims the Green Party leader. This is an outrageous derailment and a mockery of the victims. Words, however, can neither bring back to life the young family man and police officer who was stabbed to death, nor can they assuage the grief of his relatives, nor can they give citizens back their freedom and security in public spaces. The murderous mass attack in Mannheim is a beacon. How many more people will die or be seriously injured? Action must finally be taken. What we need is a turnaround on migration in Germany."

No, I'm so busy destroying and saving the German economy that I don't have time to research it. That's Donald Trump's campaign song. Couldn't you have told me straight away, now I need a new radio and I'm not going to listen to such far-right droning. And what should people do who are no longer swayed by such arrogant chatter?

And these war-mad decision-makers here, who have no idea what kind of danger they are putting this country in, have to be measured against that. And that's why Taurus, discussing this at all is not only incredibly stupid, it's negligent and exposes Germany and all our neighbors to a considerable, increased, risky danger of war."
46," Dear friends, welcome back to my Vitals Contra format. We're getting right into the election campaign and that's why we're doing it again. Shorter, just one minute, maybe a minute and a half long, especially for you and that's why we're starting with Nancy Faeser. Nancy Faeser has announced that there is an abstractly high threat level and therefore reason for great vigilance at our Christmas markets. Can we also remember what it was like back then? We could drink mulled wine without a care in the world, children could eat candy floss and ride the merry-go-round. Those days are over, thanks to mass immigration over the last ten years. And here the Office for the Protection of the Constitution says that our Christmas markets are an ideologically suitable target for people motivated by Islamism. Ms. Faeser says that consistent action is required. I can simply say that the only consistent action would be to consistently deport these people and to consistently control our borders and not let these people in in the first place. And that's why the AfD will be tabling another motion next week on the consistent control of our borders. Klimi forbid And watch."

49," A state that gives up control over its territory and access to it is no longer a state. Closing Germany's borders to illegal immigrants is neither impossible nor contrary to European law. Because without clearly defined borders, there can be neither a free and open society, nor protection of rights and property, nor a welfare state based on solidarity, nor democracy. Therefore, on February 23, AfD."

And I have yet to hear Mrs. Maischberger give a serious figure from the Federal Government. And that's why it's not possible to say anything serious at this point."
51," Every day in Germany you see reports of knife attacks, rape, crimes of brutality, murders and beatings. This must stop immediately. And if the AfD is in government, it will stop immediately. People will be deported on day 1. We wouldn't have this whole migration debate if the AfD had been in charge for the last 10 years. The CDU opened the borders and let people in. And internal security is eroding in our major cities. Internal security is eroding everywhere. But the CDU/CSU and Friedrich Merz have proven in recent years that they are not exactly the smartest. And they are proving it above all in this election campaign."
52," This motion with the five demands is, as far as the demand is concerned, copied from the AfD. The truth is that the CDU has rejected precisely this demand from us for seven years. So, that is a fact. We will also vote in favor of the influx limitation law on Friday and the motion tomorrow, because that is what distinguishes us as the AfD from the CDU/CSU. But that also means that they are xenophobic. We care about this country, that something is finally done. And we don't care about these party tactics from the CDU. The main thing is that something is done. People are demanding political solutions. We have a complete loss of control over our borders and internal security."

55," Asylum means temporary protection. Not forever. But for the past ten years, it has been common practice in Germany to allow people to stay, even if the reason for fleeing has long since ceased to exist. Whether under the traffic light government or the previous CDU government. We are putting an end to this madness, this chaos. We focus on local help, not on incentives to migrate. Those seeking protection should stay in the region and those who are here must return as soon as possible. Clear and fair for all. Therefore, on February 23, both votes for Alternative for Germany."
56," No border, no state. The borders must be closed. They must be closed at all costs. Illegal migrants must be turned away. And anyone staying here without authorization must be deported. And criminal terrorists and criminals have no place in our country. They must be deported. Therefore, on February 23, AfD."
57," It's not a suspected attack, it's a terrorist attack. Someone, an Afghan, deliberately drove into a crowd of people and injured many people. And it's always the same pattern that we hear. Namely that a rejected asylum seeker, this Afghan, came to Germany, his asylum application was rejected, he was granted tolerated status, the man has been in Germany since 2016, has been receiving social benefits since then because he was granted tolerated status, has committed several criminal offenses and has not been deported. So the question that local politicians, especially Markus Söder, must first ask themselves is, what is this man doing here? And I can tell you that with an AfD-led government, the man would not have come to the country at all. And he wouldn't have been here for a long time. And so I don't understand this political failure at all and the same thing over and over again. I think people are fed up. They want solutions, they want secure borders. They want consistent enforcement of law and order, i.e. the deportation of illegals as well as criminals. And that's why the man had no place at all. And with the AfD, he wouldn't have been here either."
58," This is no longer sensible journalism to inform citizens, but what they have been doing here, campaign-like, since Potsdam, and this has now been proven in court, this is the worst kind of activism, financed by taxpayers' money. Some journalists or activists - and I refuse to use the word now - activists really should be ashamed of themselves for getting involved. But that's just how the incentives are set, but the worst thing is how the normal citizens are being screwed here, to put it in good German. The Ampel is pursuing such a desolate policy, a disastrous policy for the Federal Republic of Germany. I don't see a single critical article to simply write down the economic data on how Germany is slipping in international comparison. Falling behind in PISA studies, uncontrolled immigration policy, excessive tax and social security contributions, then galloping inflation, loss of purchasing power, the erosion of internal security, all this is the result of the Merkel government, a ubiquitous breach of the law. The Basic Law has been broken here, the right of asylum, none of that. And the people who have pursued this policy are themselves violators of the constitution. That's not even being discussed. Where are they, simply educating people? And what Germany is currently experiencing is the worst policy this country has ever had historically. It's not even being discussed. Thank you very much."
59," The appeal to all of you is to go from door to door, convince your families, your friends, convince people of the Alternative for Germany. We must become strong, we must make this country great again, we must make this country free again, because this country deserves it.

But rational arguments no longer reach you. You can't govern Germany well and you don't want to. You are ruining it. And I'll tell you why. Because you hate your own country, because you hate Germany. This government hates Germany. At least accept the possibility of a democratic change of power and clear the way for new elections."
66," Our hand is outstretched, that's up to the Union. So we have not erected what I consider to be undemocratic firewalls that exclude millions of voters from the outset. That's what the CDU/CSU has done. But it is also disadvantageous for the Union itself, because it cements itself in coalitions with the left. Let's take a look at the eastern German states, for example in Thuringia, where they have entered into coalitions with BSW and all the left-wing parties there.

67," I think it is fundamentally unfair that pension income is taxed at all. Accordingly, we are increasing the tax-free allowances so that pensioners are left with significantly more. It is unfair what happens to pensioners in Germany. They have far too little money. And incidentally, I also think it's unfair that civil servants and politicians, for example, don't have to pay into the first pillar, the pay-as-you-go system like everyone else, i.e. the statutory system. Incidentally, this is also part of the AfD's program, that we all, I as a politician, all civil servants, have to pay into the same fund. Because they can no longer explain to anyone. And it's unfair and it's also no longer affordable. These are also costly liabilities in the future when all the civil servants and politicians retire. These are real costs. It is, very briefly, unfair, just to put it into perspective, that politicians who sit in the Bundestag for one parliamentary term receive the same pension, i.e. four years, as someone who has worked for over 40 years. And that is not acceptable. And that is why civil servants and politicians must also pay into the statutory system. We absolutely have to change this system because politicians do not have the same incentives as the working population. And that is fundamentally wrong. Politicians should have one..."

70," Ladies and gentlemen, today is a great day for democracy. We can see that there are citizen majorities and that sensible proposals can be passed. And we can see today that something like the traffic lights would not have been necessary at all. And we should take this day accordingly and this appeal goes to all other parties, especially the CDU. We should pause and think about whether we should continue to maintain the firewall, which we believe is undemocratic and excludes millions of voters from the outset. Or whether we should give serious thought to finally making serious policy for our country in the next legislature. Thank you. All right, so I have also made it very clear that our hand is outstretched. And we in the AfD parliamentary group have always maintained that we agree to sensible motions. So party tactics are out of the question for us. We vote in favor of all reasonable motions. And that's what happened today and we were able to generate a majority for it. And accordingly, things should continue in exactly the same democratic way, beyond undemocratic firewalls. Because we owe it to our country that we put this country and the people in this country first and party political tactics last. After eight years in Parliament, is this one of the shortest issues for you now? Well, preventing compulsory vaccination thanks to the AfD was an important milestone. And today was another milestone. And part of the truth is that the CDU copied this motion from us. And for seven years, as I explained in my speech today, it rejected precisely this demand. And I have also made that clear today. To what extent is this a victory for you personally? It is a victory for democracy. It is a victory for parliament. And of course it is a victory for the AfD parliamentary group. So Mr Merz isn't picking up the crumbs you've scattered. Yes, well, he has decided to adopt our demands. And the Immigration Restriction Act was also penned by us. That was rejected by the CDU itself in recent years. We would have had the majorities for a sensible policy. Limiting migration, controlling our borders. We could have done this years ago. They decided against it. And today we see the citizens, the parliament wants it differently. And the majorities will shift again, clearly towards blue-black majorities. So you can make their borders.

71," What you have just seen here, that the CDU and CSU's legislative proposal was rejected by their own parliamentary group, was the dismantling of Friedrich Merz as a candidate for chancellor. You can also see that there can only be a turnaround in migration, a genuine political change, with the Alternative for Germany. This vote has also shown that. Because the AfD parliamentary group is united. There are no dissenters who would stab a legitimate cause in the back. And accordingly, what we have seen here is the implosion of a conservative people's party. There can only be real political change with the AfD. And so we will see how the next three weeks go. Friedrich Merz jumped as a tiger and ended up as a bedside rug. It will not have escaped your attention that we had tumultuous scenes in parliament today and on Wednesday. It is pure chaos in the established parties. And the chaos speaks for itself: anyone who wants a stable government and real political change. They will vote for the Alternative for Germany. Because Merz has been dismantled, he doesn't have his own party behind him. And what he said today was also quite clear. There is not only February 23, there is also February 24, when he opened up to the SPD and the Greens. He wants to form a coalition with these two parties. He does not want to close the option. He has ruled it out with us. And accordingly, we will have black, green and red after the election. And Friedrich Merz does not stand for political change. And that's why he suffered this bitter defeat today. You have seen the chaos here today. The old parties are no longer capable of putting things in order here. We have a country in free fall. We're down there in terms of economic policy and migration policy. And then this kind of theater is pulled off here. Weeks of meetings are canceled. It will take weeks to make soundings. So no work is being done here. Important motions and bills are simply rejected and taken off the agenda beforehand. The truth is that the influx limitation law was already on the agenda in December, but was taken off again for fear of accidental majorities. And that actually says it all, that the CDU has no political will whatsoever to actually implement things, honestly. The fact that it was put back on the agenda was purely an electoral tactic. And accordingly, people are no longer buying it from Friedrich Merz. He knew he had to act and that's the only reason he was forced to do it. And if the Immigration Restriction Act and other important proposals and legislative issues had been voted on earlier, there might not have been the deaths. And that is simply part of the election. We must finally make policy for our country and for its citizens. And stop this theater here. Mr. Merz is very clumsy. And he is not only clumsy, he is not stringent. Ultimately, Friedrich Merz has brought himself down. Because he is an untrustworthy candidate for chancellor and does not follow clear lines. You've actually seen this over the last few months, twelve months. Then they say that, then they immediately row back again. And anyone who says on Wednesday about the motion he won, ""I deeply regret that this motion was accepted"", is not a candidate for chancellor. He cannot lead this country. He can't even lead his own parliamentary group and his own party. What we are seeing here are firewall deaths. And there will be more of them. And I have just said it several times. The reason why this law could not be passed today is the CDU/CSU. The Union is not united. And that is the basic problem with the CDU/CSU. Voters don't know what the CDU/CSU actually stands for. Is it a Merkel now? Or is it green after all? Or even greener? You don't even know what you're getting any more. And even Merz doesn't have a handle on things. And that's why the thing just crashed. He can't be chancellor. He can't be a candidate for chancellor. What we've just seen is that the CDU has dumped its own candidate for chancellor. That is part of the truth. And later, on February 23rd, 24th, we will not be able to achieve a reasonable majority with the CDU for a political change in the CDU and with the SPD and the Greens. That is the firewall. That is the blockade. You can only form unstable coalitions here because you have this blockade attitude towards the Alternative for Germany. And accordingly, there will only be instability. And Friedrich Merz is partly responsible for the fact that this country is being led into an inability to govern. Even though we urgently need solutions. This country is on the ground. All the factors are negative. And the CDU is also partly responsible for this. Accelerated by the traffic lights. In this country, decisions should be made as quickly as possible and policies should be made for Germany. Policies for German citizens. That's what you expect from political decision-makers. And instead, meetings are canceled here and chaos is created. All in all, I think the basic approach of the established parties is irresponsible, what they are doing to this country.üsstädchen and Betriebs. probably 20 the d名 for us at"

It has been violating the Basic Law, the Al-Ghazul Act, international rules and the Dublin Regulation. Germany has been breaking the law for over ten years, starting with Angela Merkel and continuing with the traffic lights. That is a fact that we have to deal with. We have rampant crime in Germany, rampant crime by foreigners, as evidenced by the police crime statistics. Immigrants, for example from Afghanistan, have the highest crime rate for crimes of violence, followed by Iraqis and Syrians. And that is a huge problem. And I believe that this problem has not been addressed in recent years. Anyone who has addressed it, like us, has been placed in the right-wing corner. I think that's completely wrong. We have to open up this corridor of opinion in order to discuss these problems in our country. Because otherwise it is exactly what you describe, it opens up a climate of socio-political condemnation. And that is why we must first and foremost abide by the law on the part of the government.

Through technological openness, i.e. nuclear power, coal and gas with base load capacity. Renewable energies are also welcome, but without gigantic subsidies to the detriment of our country and the taxpayer. We will abolish the EEG.

When I'm at home and then really come home from such busy things, I like to sleep in when I can, so I don't set an alarm clock. So I actually always wake up at 6 o'clock at my standard time. I don't need an alarm clock. But then I also like to roll over again when I have the time. And have a coffee in peace and quiet. I love it. What is your current favorite song? Currently. Can I look it up? Gosh, which one is that? Ah, man. Ah, this song. Where's my phone? I'll tell you. What's your favorite alcoholic drink? My favorite? I actually quite like sparkling wines. So sparkling wine, prosecco and champagne, I also like to drink a glass or two. Very rarely. But when I do, it's a lot of fun. So I've made a habit of it now. I'm a bit older now. If I only drink a little alcohol, I don't sleep well. So when I'm working, I don't drink alcohol at all. And if I do, it's only once in a while. Because I can, I mean, a glass or a bottle of beer, then I might as well leave it alone. But then at the weekend, I sometimes drink two or three glasses, because otherwise I find it all a bit boring. But I rarely drink alcohol. But when I do, I do it properly. But not with the handbrake on so that I still have to drive. So if I do, I don't have to drive anymore. Alice Weidel is known as a woman with a bun and pearl necklace. Will we ever see you with your hair down?

But then, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to speak because people recognize me by my voice. Sometimes when I'm out and about with my wife and we're really in a very, very busy environment, we sometimes don't speak because I don't want people to recognize me by my voice, because they just won't leave me alone. So it's like, well, can we take a selfie and then like, I think you're stupid. Bye."
84," Germany has alliance obligations within NATO, of course. Incidentally, we have neglected these NATO alliance commitments for the last 20 years. That remains to be said. Point two is that Germany is no longer capable of its own national defense. Our Bundeswehr is not fit for purpose. And why do I say that? I believe it is wrong. It sends out the wrong signal that German soldiers are being stationed in Ukraine. Who is supposed to provide security? Yes, well, it has to be an international peacekeeping force, without Germany. We will not be available to send German soldiers to Ukraine. We are not capable of doing that. And incidentally, the connection is also being made between the Taurus weapons delivery and the deployment of German soldiers. Together, that is purely logical. Ms. Hayali, unfortunately we are still a long way from that point, because Friedrich Merz called for Taurus just last Saturday.

88," The burden on citizens and companies is enormous. Taxes, levies and ever more bureaucracy are robbing us of growth and prosperity. That is why we will immediately reduce income tax, abolish the solidarity surcharge and completely suspend VAT on basic foodstuffs. We will free companies from cost-intensive supply chain laws and other bureaucratic requirements. In this way, we will strengthen the economy, relieve the burden on citizens and create growth. On February 23, vote AfD for more money in your pocket and a strong economy."
89," The energy crisis is affecting everyone. Electricity prices are exploding, forests are being cut down for wind turbines and security of supply is dwindling. We will make the worldwide standard of electricity production through cheap nuclear energy possible again in Germany. I will bring the cheapest gas onto the market, regardless of who supplies it and through which pipeline. And our state-of-the-art coal-fired power plants, which are the envy of all, will remain on the grid for as long as possible. So we will have affordable energy prices again. On February 23, both votes for Alternative for Germany for affordable energy and a secure supply."
90," Have you ever asked yourself what is on our side of the firewall? Affordable housing for the people in our country. Energy that you can afford again. A country that doesn't lead the world in green taxes and energy taxes, but in technological openness and progress. A Germany that protects its citizens and not those who should not be here. Quite simply. A Germany for you. Time for Germany. Time for Alice Weidel. Time for Germany."
91," I would like to see the security of our own population once again take center stage. We have to make policy for our country, for our people. And that includes robust border security and kicking out people who can't behave here."
92," Above all, we want to relieve the burden on low incomes, middle incomes and families. They do this through tax allowances. 15,000 per adult and 12,000 per child. We want family splitting. And for a family of five, that would mean that they would actually remain tax-free up to almost 70,000 euros gross. And that is a wonderful tax relief program, which I think would please everyone here, every employee in Germany. On the other hand, in order to finance this, they must of course reduce expenditure. This state is spending far too much despite record tax revenues. And that's where we have to cut back on senseless and inefficient spending. And then they will be able to finance this very well and even have a surplus afterwards. And above all, which is perhaps also important, we need to reduce consumption taxes. That is also what you have just mentioned. Consumption taxes such as VAT affect us all. As soon as we buy something, the taxes are far too high. Here, too, we need to make significant reductions. That is also what we are doing."
93," While Donald Trump wants peace negotiations and is also entering into them, the Europeans are actually more likely to step on the gas. 700 billion, a huge sum from the EU for Ukraine, for weapons and financial aid. Friedrich Merz is not ruling out the Taurus weapons system, a German weapons system for Ukraine. He called for it last Saturday, so full throttle into escalation. And we, I personally, think that's completely the wrong way to go. We need peace negotiations, because at the end of every war there is always peace. And it should be brought about as quickly as possible."
94," Dear friends, now every vote counts for the AfD, because only we will change Germany for a real migration turnaround, for a Germany that is rich again, prosperous and safe. Go to the polling station today, but don't go alone, take at least two more friends with you and then we will change Germany together."
95, Magdeburg. Several dead and injured near Tärn. We can all feel it. Germany is going downhill. Our country needs a real turnaround now. I am Alice Weidel and I ask you to vote for the AfD on February 23. Because it's time for Germany.
96," Yes, I think we need to talk fundamentally about why contributions have actually risen. The root cause analysis has been completely dropped and the cause is quite clear. The reason that contributions are constantly rising is these parties, as they sit here. Because they have let millions of people into the funds who have never paid into them. And this now has to be absorbed by the contributors. At the same time, all provisions have been dissolved to the tune of billions. This means that liabilities are accumulating for people who have never paid into our social security system. And I think that's completely wrong. It is a wrong policy against our own working population, who pay contributions. And who are constantly confronted with rising social security contributions. I think that's completely wrong. I also think it's anti-social. And accordingly, we must stop illegal migration and immigration into our social systems. Nobody can pay for that any more."
97," And it's not only about bureaucracy, it's also about taxes. Germany has the highest taxes of all OECD countries. So the normal German employee, he works more than half of a year for the state. You have to imagine that. Like with taxes plus social security. So more than half of the year you work for this dysfunctioning state. Because like the state does not provide the vital provisions for the people here."
98," Germany had the most modern and safest nuclear power plants in the world. And they are being shut down. Why? Because of green ideology. Plants that are still operational are quickly refurbished and connected to the grid with the AfD. We are making our country fit for the future with research and next-generation reactors. Safe, clean and affordable energy for all. Therefore, on February 23, vote for the Alternative for Germany with both votes."
99," Dear friends, I'm on my way to Hamburg, where the leftists have announced their intention to reduce half the city to rubble. Why? Because I'm performing there. I'm already looking forward to it. But I put on this heart sweater especially for the Antifa. So I'm looking forward to a really good event. Make love, not war."
100," Our state allows people to throw away their passports before they cross our borders that are not protected and controlled. So 57%, almost 60% of the people coming into our country through an open border, they throw away their papers. Why do they do that? Because once entered our country, our funny country, with this funny immigration policy, they cannot be deported anymore. So that's the reason why. So our state, our government, like the Angela Merkel government and the last one, they proclaimed a policy that everyone can choose to cross our border, to immigrate into our social security system, and cannot be deported afterwards because they threw away their passports."
101," During the coronavirus crisis, the government took away people's basic rights and destroyed their livelihoods. To this day, there has been no comprehensive investigation. I will stand up for every single victim of the corona measures. We need clarity and clarification. Who lied? What worked at all? What was necessary? What will we do better next time? And who was just cashing in? I will clarify all this with our parliamentary group, the Bundestag and investigations. I am at their side. On February 23, with both votes for Alternative for Germany, for clarification and a new beginning."
102," Should I die? Incidentally, this is a very, very big issue in our home. I'd be happy to explain that to you. We are actually discussing it, me and my wife. What happens to me if I die in an attack? What about inheritance tax and everything? How is that actually regulated? And I believe that our civil partnership should not be subordinate to a traditional marriage. Of course, I live it. I live in a registered civil partnership. And I believe that a registered civil partnership should have the same legal status as marriage. Why is the word not in a party manifesto? Because it is self-evident. Why shouldn't I and my wife have the same tax status as in a normal marriage?"
103," A central theme of your election campaign is stopping illegal migration. You recently said that the borders would be closed from day 1. Would you build a fence to achieve this? I beg your pardon? Would you build a fence for that? If it's necessary, of course. We need secure borders and we will stop illegal migration. And that would actually have been the task of any government to protect its own population."
104, Thank you. Thank you.
105," It should be noted that Donald Trump is now implementing exactly what we as the AfD have been demanding for three years. And that is an immediate ceasefire and entry into peace negotiations. Another reason why I have just voted yes is that Friedrich Merz only on Saturday called for the Taurus missile system, a German missile system, to be delivered to Ukraine a few days ago. I think this is an escalatory approach and I think it is wrong. And accordingly, Germany should no longer be involved there at all, especially not with arms deliveries, not with the deployment of soldiers and not with financial aid. We absolutely must put the brakes on this issue, because the danger of escalation is still there. And accordingly, as the Alternative for Germany, we will of course support Donald Trump in his peace efforts. As the second strongest force here in Germany. And I think it would be a very good development overall if Friedrich Merz did not pull out with the delivery of Taurus. and I hold that again."
106," Citizens have to contend with rising prices, electricity shortages and environmental destruction. Whole forests are being cut down again for inefficient, ugly wind turbines. The AfD puts an end to this madness. No more subsidies for inefficient climate projects, no more EEG levy, no more ideological taxes. We will make energy affordable again and secure Germany's supply. An end to dependency and uncertainty. Therefore, on February 23, vote Alternative for Germany with both your votes."
107, me These are the best practices you carry out mm
108," People have the feeling that they have scissors in their heads and that they can no longer say what they really think. And I believe that we all need to be more careful about that. And so I think it's very good that we have an entrepreneur who says, okay, I support the fact that everyone can have their opinion. And accordingly, the admiration not only for his entrepreneurial spirit, but also for his approach in buying Twitter for this horrendous price. It's fair to say that. No one has managed that before him."
109," We want freedom, we want a market economy, we want every individual to have the freedom to make their own life and economic decisions freely and without state coercion and interference. And so the state should withdraw from these areas of life."
110," We have a strong majority for the AfD and CDU. Voters want a center-right government. And it is ultimately up to the CDU/CSU whether they want to implement this. At the moment, it doesn't look like it will. Friedrich Merz has decided to stick to his blockade stance towards the AfD. We consider this blockade to be undemocratic. You cannot exclude millions of voters per se. And accordingly, it is up to the CDU/CSU how it deals with this. What is to be expected, however, is that in a coalition with the SPD, it will not be able to implement any of the things it promised its own voters, which were essentially AfD positions. That should be rejected. That belongs instead. Who is here with a view to believes a Savi Sexual representative is."
111," Among other things, we are very strong among young voters. That is also a strong indicator that we are the party of the future. They have been able to form a very good platform here, a strategic platform that has the best prerequisites to overtake the CDU in the next election within the next few years. In other words, to become the strongest force and to take the government mandate for the next federal elections with us."
112, Thank you.
113," Germany should start to articulate its own interests. That is our task. As you have just said, I have of course called Germany a slave state via Spitz. What do you mean by that? I believe that we must stop free-riding at the expense of the USA and also stop allowing ourselves to be drawn into US conflicts. These wars that the USA is waging are not our wars. In the Taiwan issue, for example, or in the Indo-Pacific, I don't know what Ms. Baerbock was doing anywhere in Indonesia, but we have no business there. We have our security interests here."
114," We have such an important election year ahead of us and we, the AfD, have set out to stay and, above all, to overtake the CDU/CSU because the focus is on the people. Because we have had enough, we really have had enough of the conditions in our big cities. We have to get used to, or we should get used to, civil war-like conditions on New Year's Eve. And I can tell you that we don't want to get used to what happened again this year, as in previous years, in the big cities on New Year's Eve."
115," I am a free speech fangirl. I think it's extremely important, and I would like to admit this, that someone like Elon Musk, as a successful entrepreneur, has taken money into his hands, and not a little, 244 billion US dollars, to buy Twitter, i.e. today X, because he clearly says that what is broadcast in the mainstream, he calls it legacy media, is too one-sided and he wants to open up the corridor."
116," While millions are receiving citizens' income, our companies are desperately looking for workers. The citizen's income will become an activating basic income restricted to citizens and legal EU nationals. With an AfD government, performance will once again be rewarded and everyone who can work will be motivated to do so. The times of stagnation are over. Therefore, vote Alternative for Germany on February 23rd."
117," But even if you decide to stay at home as a young mother, for example, you should be paid enough to have freedom of choice. And if you decide to train in your profession and your children have to go to daycare or kindergarten, the fees must be abolished. In any case, daycare fees must be abolished, because otherwise the problem you are currently experiencing will arise. If it were up to me, kindergarten too. That's all that needs to be exempted so that you as a young mother, really you as a single parent, that's extremely difficult, so that you really have a good feeling that you can manage financially."
118," As you can see, the atmosphere here is extremely good. We are twice as big and twice as efficient, as you can see from the speed here. We have an orderly store. We have an orderly parliamentary group, which is more than you can say for all the other groups. We look forward to working together. I'm looking forward to working with Tino Chrupalla and the newly elected Group Executive Committee. And yes, we will see what the next legislature brings. Friedrich Merz has thrown his main election promises overboard in less than 24 hours. We are getting unstable conditions in Germany and we won't have to wait another four years for the whole thing to fall apart again. And today we have set ourselves the goal of overtaking the CDU as the strongest force in the German Bundestag over the next few years through our opposition work as leader of the opposition in this parliamentary group. That is our goal and we will achieve it. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
119," 10, 9, ignition sequence start, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running, liftoff, we have a liftoff. Ladies and gentlemen here in Halle an der Saale and dear viewers in the livestream. Welcome to the big election rally of your Alternative for Germany. Our beautiful country is in a deep crisis. The policies of the old parties, the left-green zeitgeist, the woke ideology - all this has led us to the abyss. And the figures are frightening. Attacks with knives are increasing significantly in Germany. We warned about this and unfortunately, unfortunately we were right about everything. You are destroying the German economy for the sake of alleged climate protection. This is certainly not what the Minister of Economic Affairs had in mind. Again, no good news. ThyssenKrupp's steel division has announced massive cutbacks. There used to be secure jobs here. Now VW is planning plant closures. Opel is cutting back production. Bosch cuts 5500 jobs. Stagnant excavators in companies. Too much bureaucracy. Energy prices too high. The economic situation is serious. After Merkel and after Ampel, this country is on the brink. We have deindustrialization in the country. We still have open borders. We have high inflation. We have high energy prices. And we have the threat of war in Europe. So we actually have huge problems on all fronts. And that's why we need to finally get our state back on its feet. So I think we finally need an AfD in a federal government. Time for a turnaround. Time for our middle class. Time for strong families. Time for our prosperity. Time to make work pay again. Time for affordable energy. Time for secure pensions. Time for our farmers. Time to give our young people a future. Time for secure borders. Time for our security. Time for peace. Time for free speech. Time for Germany to work again. Time for the new people's party. Time for our country. Time for German interests. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for Germany. Time for the AfD. Time for the AfD. Time for the AfD. Time for Schwarzfurt Gold. Time for our candidate for chancellor Alice Weidel. Because Germans want normality and they have the right to it. They want work, they want security, they want prosperity. Germans want freedom, they want individual freedom, they want entrepreneurial freedom. We want freedom. Time for Germany."
120," Citizens pay and pay, but hardly anything reaches them. We say enough. We are raising the tax-free allowance to 14,000 euros, reducing taxes on companies and abolishing the CO2 tax. This will keep their money where it belongs, with them. Tax relief for those who keep our country running. That is our plan for Germany. That's why on February 23, both votes for Alternative for Germany. Subtitling by ZDF, 2020"
121," The CDU is currently campaigning with AfD positions. And the truth is that it will not be able to implement these promises with its preferred coalition partners, i.e. the Greens and the SPD, because these other parties are against them. It will only be able to implement its election promises for political change with the AfD. And it's best to vote for the original rather than a copy, because I don't think voters are being given a clean bill of health here. To put it bluntly, voters are being lied to by the CDU."
122," And we are on the side, we as the AfD, we are on the side of freedom. We don't want state coercion. We want the state to withdraw economically and we want it to withdraw socially. And above all, we want it to withdraw from our educational institutions with all its gender nonsense and diversity."
123," The German passport must not be devalued. Yet all other parties are planning to speed up naturalization even more, lower the requirements and make dual passports the standard. This leads to conflicts of loyalty and undermines our national identity. With the AfD, the passport will remain what it is. A valuable asset that must be earned through clear integration efforts. Therefore, on February 23, both votes for the Alternative for Germany. Subtitling of the ZDF, 2020"
124," How can it be that I and other AfD functionaries are under massive personal protection? How can it be that we have a huge contingent of police and authorities here because of the left-wing extremist perpetrators of violence who pick on us at home, who carry out attacks on AfD functionaries? How can all this be in a free society that we actually want to have?"
125," Donald Trump is the only one who has ever made peace in Ukraine an issue, that he wants to end this terrible, unnecessary war. And he has also made that promise. And accordingly, my personal hope in Donald Trump is very high. Incidentally, Donald Trump was also the president who did not start a war during his time in office."
126," Take part now! Download the graphic or video from alisweidel.de, publish it on your own channel and send us the link to your contribution. Friends, this is the final product. We are giving away three signed Team Alis shirts per week as a thank you to all entrants. Thank you very much."
127," We want to have a proud Germany. We want to be as proud of our country as you are of yours. And you have achieved that. Why you are a symbol for us as the Alternative for Germany, a symbol of reason and a symbol of sovereignty and independence, that is what I want for our country too."
128," We have the highest energy prices in the world. This means that the first thing we have to do is bring energy prices down, including as a driver of inflation. And the way to do this is to be open to technology. For example, through base-load capable nuclear power, through coal power, through gas. But also, if you like, through renewable energies. But without this gigantic subsidy policy to the detriment of our country. We absolutely must put an end to this and that is why we will do two things in government. We will abolish the EEG and we will abolish the CO2 tax, which was introduced by the CDU. It makes everything more expensive, especially for consumers. You've just seen that in the article. Heating, then at the pumps, the CO2 levy, the increase in it, will take full effect in 2027. And what will happen? We will have fuel price increases of up to 1 euro per liter. Just to give you an idea of what consumers will be facing. Heating and gas bills will no longer be affordable. And we are absolutely against any ban policy. Everyone should be free to decide which heating system to install and which car to drive. Every consumer should decide for themselves what they want. We don't need bans for that. And every company should be free to decide for itself what it produces. If the German automotive companies want to produce combustion engines, a cutting-edge technology in Germany, then they should do it. I simply no longer want the market to be distorted in the automotive sector by subsidizing e-cars. Point taken. Point taken. Dot made. Point made. Point grin. 왜 Ceiling running information. Point landed against 119. point gercenturyrailend.吟 is leadership quarter, Authority Abstell and stattfindetдаf are."
129," Firstly. Taxes must come down. Reduce energy taxes, value-added tax and income tax, abolish the CO2 levy and genuinely scrap and abolish the unspeakable EEG. Secondly. The ECB must be made to fulfill its mandate and ensure stable money. Thirdly. Government spending must be focused on the essentials. Internal and external security, guaranteeing the rule of law and public order. No more ideological politics, patronage and handing out money all over the world. Fourthly. Illegal migration and immigration into the social systems are already back above 2015 levels, but they are opening the last floodgates and sending new migration signals through almost unconditional naturalization. Fifthly. The energy supply must be expanded. We must demoralize energy production and energy imports. In plain language, this means putting an end to wasting resources on wind power and photovoltaics. They are not crisis-proof and not reliable. Wind power only contributes a fraction of the installed capacity to supply. Nuclear power almost 100 percent. Sixthly. Normalization of gas imports from Russia and, if necessary, opening of Nord Stream 2. Yes, of course. Secondly. Extending the lifetimes of nuclear power plants that are still active, reactivating those that have been decommissioned and, of course, building new nuclear power plants. We need nuclear power for clean, safe and affordable energy. And it's nice that the CDU now seems to be gradually realizing this, Mr Merz, it's thanks to your party, which has been dancing to the green-red tune for 16 years, that we have this misery in the first place. The energy transition to nowhere is the result of your policies and 16 years of Merkel. And the continuation of the energy transition and the misuse of the crisis to push it even further will lead to certain ruin."
130," If the state can't handle our money, the taxpayer, which incidentally already has record tax revenues, if it can't handle it, then please don't invent any more tax rates, as it is already doing anyway, via the CO2 levy, then something else will be added here, then it should tighten its belt even more. And what does this state offer its own population? It offers its own population eroding internal security, unprotected borders, a dilapidated infrastructure etc. pp. And the highest energy prices in the world."
131," The federal government at the time, the ""Ampel"", and they were all together, they had the SPD, they had the Greens and the FDP, but also the state government with the CDU, they had the information that the mRNA vaccine had a 20-fold higher risk exposure than normal. These people knew that. That's why I'm all the happier that it was only with the strength of the Alternative for Germany in the German Bundestag that compulsory vaccination was prevented."
132," In Germany, cash benefits are distributed to asylum seekers without any checks on how the money is used. This is a thing of the past. With the AfD, there will only be benefits in kind, and consistently so. Social benefits will also be converted into benefits in kind so that the aid reaches those in need directly. The message is clear. Germany is not a self-service store. Those who are not allowed to stay must leave. Time for a real repatriation offensive. Therefore, on February 23, both votes for the Alternative for Germany."
133," The point is, I only represent the voters. And there are millions of voters in Germany. You can't go there and say I'm excluding millions of voters. I actually think that's undemocratic and of course, as you said, not particularly clever either. The voters decide who they want in government. And the will of the voters is actually quite clear in the polls. The voters want a black-blue coalition. Quite simply."
134," We have a plan for the future of Germany. I have outlined this plan in various speeches in the German Bundestag. And this plan includes many motions from the AfD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag, which were rejected by all other parliamentary groups, especially the CDU. Why do I say that? The CDU is standing here until February 23 and blatantly copying the AfD program. It is a copy of our election program and our position in the parliamentary groups. And I can only say to you, don't fall for it, because who does the CDU actually want to govern with later and implement what it has copied from us? It is simply impossible. Thank you very much."
135," The CDU wants to take on 900 billion in debt. Another broken election promise. We say no new debt. You and the other taxpayers paid around 425 billion euros to the federal government last year. And the government spent it on all sorts of things. Just not for you. We want to change that. Get rid of migration costs of around 50 billion euros. Only qualified immigration to Germany. Major reform of citizens' income so that work pays again. Put an end to the migration magnet. Out of the Paris Climate Agreement and away with climate ideology. No more cycle paths in Peru and gender-neutral toilets in Ghana. Equipment for the Bundeswehr instead of Ukraine. No more taxpayers' money for NGOs that demonstrate against citizens. Reform of the EU and reduction of funding. Child benefit only for children in Germany. With us, there are savings of around 181 billion euros. That's about 43 percent of federal tax revenue. Time for Germany. Time for change. Only with the AfD. Subtitling. BR 2018"
136," The teaching profession must be made much more attractive so that more people decide to become teachers again. After all, it's a tough job these days. When I went to school, when I was your age, it may not have been like that. But it's the same nowadays, from what I hear, even from teacher friends, some of the classes are quite demanding. And so we need to make the teaching job more attractive overall. May I ask how exactly? Sure, I'd love to. You make it more attractive by first of all offering significantly more jobs, training positions for teachers. Because the teacher shortage hasn't just started today, it's been going on for over ten years. We know that we have a shortage of skilled workers there too. I mean, we have shortages everywhere and, to be honest, the politicians have actually missed everything. That's the reason why I got into politics in the first place. Because it bothers me too. And that's what you always end up doing, people should be paid reasonably for the job they do. When you go out afterwards, as a teacher now, you think about it, yes, how am I supposed to feed my family here now, is it enough, should I put myself through the stress? Oh, then I'd better call in sick. None of these are good location factors. And now, the more important thing is that you feel that you are well educated as a young woman. I want you to have a really good future and a great education. Frausti Freund, won Și to what we see."
137," The AfD firmly believes that we must control our borders, make our borders secure and immediately turn illegal immigrants away from our borders. That is our program. We have proposed it. It was rejected by the CDU."
138," Now it's really enough. CDU, have you gone mad? The parents in Aschaffenburg have just found out that their two-year-old child has been stabbed to death. Two dead. And what does the most important woman in the March CDU, Julia Klöckner, post? Always men. No women. Why? Yes, are they crazy? Who else would it have been from the Arab world? It's 90% men who come here. And no women. And which men are to blame for all this? They're called March. They're called Söder. Who keep the borders open. And who, with their fucking firewall, are preventing the fact that they, together with the AfD in the Bundestag, have long since decided to close the borders. Expel the perpetrators. And finally peace. But what are they posting? They are men. And not women. Have they gone mad?"
139, But they are spending billions on the illusion that they will be able to influence the climate in a few decades' time. But there is no money for protection against real dangers in the here and now. German taxpayers' money goes all over the world. Flood and disaster protection in our own country is being neglected and cut to the bone.
140," But anyone who chooses to put the fate of Germany in the hands of Friedrich Merz is choosing war, ladies and gentlemen. And they are not only voting for war, they are also voting for Robert Habeck. Who will vote for a continuation of the Green policy of paternalism, deindustrialization, impoverishment, economic incompetence and a politically desired energy emergency?"
141," As the AfD, we will not allow our country to be overrun by people of whom we do not know who they are and where they come from. We will put an end to this and we will communicate this to the whole world, that Germany's borders are closed and that we will immediately deport illegal immigrants and criminals, rapists and murderers. That is our program for the German population."
142," Courts in this country would have the foremost task of dispensing justice incorruptibly and independently, regardless of person or opinion. The appointment of the highest judges would be removed from the influence of the political parties, and the public prosecutor's offices would be independent of instructions from the Minister of Justice. This is because the judiciary, as the third power, has to control the executive and not confirm it."
143," As Alternative for Germany, we want a genuine political turnaround in our country. We have also set this out in our program, in our speeches in the Bundestag and state parliaments. We want a genuine turnaround in migration, we want secure borders and, above all, we want energy prices to be lowered. We are far too expensive in international competition, jobs and consumers depend on this, and people's consumption costs are far too high. Here, too, we need to bring prices down overall. And we want to return to an ordoliberal economic policy with sensible framework conditions for companies. Ultimately, this means lowering taxes and diversifying the energy supply, i.e. allowing nuclear power again, openness to technology. In other words, we are against the ban on combustion engines. We should start producing combustion engines in Germany again, stop the subsidies for e-cars, so that we have real competition in the car market and therefore more market-based competition overall."
144," I believe that our relationship with our foreign friends, both with our European neighbors and with the USA, as well as with the USA, China and Russia, has never been so bad. We have really managed to destroy our good relationship over the last ten years. And as the second strongest force in Germany, it will also be my primary task to help repair this relationship. I see that as my primary task. Because it can't go on like this."
145," Removing subsidies, which is what I'm talking about, by abolishing the EEG and introducing real competition on the energy market, would even save money because they would no longer have to pay out the subsidy. It's quite clear what we're talking about here. We need real competition and then all forms of energy have to face up to competition. And then you can simply draw up sensible investment calculations. But it doesn't work that way because the price is distorted by subsidies that the taxpayer has to pay on top of the highest energy costs. Bans on the automobile market, the ban on combustion engines is fundamentally wrong. And we must stop this ban policy. Consumers must decide for themselves what they buy and producers must decide for themselves what they produce. And this competition has been destroyed by politics over the past 10 or 15 years. I think that's fundamentally wrong. I think that's fundamentally wrong. I think that's fundamentally wrong."
146," Law and order must be applied consistently. Borders must be closed. Illegal entry must be prevented for those not entitled to stay, and criminals and Islamist fanatics in particular must be deported. And also to Afghanistan. So that something really changes. On February 23. AfD."
147," Welcome to the AfD's big clique calendar. Today Fancy Nancy's fight against the right. Fancy Nancy, in Thuringia, the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution is suspected of having committed crimes. What do you think? We need to do more in the fight against the right. Is that all you can think of? He allegedly threatened employees with physical violence and drew up reports on the AfD in violation of the law. We need to do more in the fight against the right. So Nancy, you can't just ignore this. He is even said to have passed on official secrets to Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk. That is not acceptable. We have to do more in the fight against the right. Apparently Fancy Nancy is not capable of answering simple questions. What should people who expect real enlightenment do? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
148," When a Minister of the Interior like Nancy Faeser, whose priority is to be depicted with rainbow armbands, stands up and restricts freedom of expression by criticizing people who think differently, who have a conservative opinion or simply do not share this Minister's opinion, who criticize governments, that they are suddenly placed in the right-wing corner, that civil servants have to expect disciplinary proceedings, that they are thrown out of their jobs, that their pensions are cut, one wonders, my goodness, this woman, she really seems to have gone through the best school, this is GDR 2.0, what is being done here today. That's why AfD on February 23."
149," They fob off the victims with empty phrases. They relativize the threat and, like their party leader Ricarda Lang, put religious fanatics on the same level as drunken greeters in an unbearable trivialization. They misuse the resources of the security authorities to take action against members of the opposition instead of tackling the greatest and most urgent threat to internal security, imported Islamist extremism and its left-wing extremist thugs."
150," Dear friends, on September 1, the future will be decided not only for Saxony and Thuringia, but also for Germany. Make the AfD the strongest force. Make our top candidates prime ministers. And you will bring about change in all political areas. So vote AfD. Subtitling of the ZDF, 2020"
151," Welcome to the big AfD clique calendar. Today, Annalena is jealous. Annalena and Friedrich, what's wrong with you? You're so quiet today. I'm jealous. Oh, why is that? Friedrich likes Robert much better than Misch. But that's not true at all, Annalena. I love you both equally. Then why is Robert allowed to stay in his ministry and not me? Don't worry, Annalena. Of course you'll stay Foreign Minister. And Robert will remain Economics Minister and Schem will stay in the Ministry of Agriculture. Nothing will change with my CDU. And what should the people who want real change do? They should vote AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
152," The teacher scolds you. Everyone gets their... Thank you. Gladly, gladly. Leave right now. Thank you. You're welcome. This is a secure area and you don't have to walk around freely. Please come with me once."
153," Germany is in the midst of its worst economic crisis. How are politicians reacting? Not at all. No work is being done in Berlin. Meetings have been suspended. No more work is to be done here until the new elections in February. And with the help of the CDU. To put it bluntly, the CDU means standstill. Germany has the highest energy prices in the world. As a result, companies are either going abroad or going bankrupt. And Hans-Werner Sinn has named the poison list, as he calls it, very precisely, which is the crime of politics. I'll start here. Oil heating ban from 2024. Combustion engines from 2035. Tightening of the fleet consumption formula in 2018. Incidentally, the AfD was the only parliamentary group to protest against this. The CDU happily voted in favor. Coal out by 2038. Natural gas phase-out by 2045. Planning to dismantle and convert the gas grids by 2024. In other words, the gas grids are simply being ripped out here without any alternative. That only works with children's book authors like Habeck. Then the Energy Efficiency Act 2023. Nuclear phase-out. The last safe nuclear power plants were simply shut down last year. Yes, that's how it looks. And that means we need a real political turnaround. And that's only possible with the AfD."
154," We are fundamentally, and have been calling for years, for the European Union to reduce its competences. We believe that the European Union, with its bureaucratic superstructure, is too encroaching on industry and also on the nation states, where the elected parliaments are. And there we have been calling for years for a reduction in competences, i.e. that supranational law no longer breaks national law. The ban on combustion engines comes from the European Union, from the Commission."
155," Mr. Habeck, the eternal philosophy student who has written children's books, thinks he is so competent that he could now take over the super ministry of economics and energy. That would be exactly the same as if I, as an economist with a doctorate, were to say, ""Gee, what are we doing today? These rocket sciences interest me. I would like to be responsible when the next Mars rocket is patched up. And I would like to take final delivery of it. That would be exactly the same, it would be just as presumptuous. And that's why we as the Alternative for Germany say, yes, maybe I can do it after all, who knows. That's why we as Alternative for Germany, and above all I personally, say that we first need a TÜV test for government politicians. TÜV! MOT! MOT! MOT! MOT! MOT! MOT!"
156," What about the people? People are suffering from what is known as a loss of real purchasing power. They no longer have any purchasing power. They realize that their money is worth less and less of what they earn. Prices are rising, it's what Habeck doesn't understand, what nobody here understands. We are dealing with such high, very strong, serious inflationary tendencies that not only one person has to work, but two people have to work at the same time. That is a common principle here. Then rents rise. We have asset price inflation. Everything goes up. Food prices. You have to go to the supermarket to see what's actually going on here. People can't even afford it anymore. And then there's the car, the commute to work. Who is supposed to pay for all this at the pump?"
157," Angela Merkel also found this to be the case, and you have to agree with her, because cheap Russian natural gas has concealed the failure of the green energy transition. For years. It was complementary to the EEG and then prices went through the roof anyway. As I just said, Germany had the highest energy prices even before the Russian invasion, before the sanctions policy. So that means it's quite clear that our problems are homemade."
158," Taurus is the next step in the development of a Marschlu missile, which was produced in Germany and must also be operated by German soldiers. And it has a significantly greater range than the American Ettecamps medium-range missiles or the British medium-range missiles. Taurus could theoretically reach Moscow. And accordingly, Taurus would be a crossing of the red line for the Russians. And that would mean that the NATO alliance case would come into force. And that would be a complete catastrophe, as perhaps everyone here can imagine. We are walking into a major war with a nuclear power, and completely without need. And why? Because someone who has no idea at all, no idea how Friedrich Merz is actually flirting with handing over German technology to Ukraine. And this delivery, the firing of a German missile from Ukraine at a Russian target, will result in a Russian reaction, I will predict what will happen, that a German target will be fired at. That is the NATO alliance case, then we will be at war. And that must be prevented at all costs. The AfD has set out to prevent Taurus at all costs. We will work in the next Bundestag to ensure that Taurus is prevented. Because Taurus is a great danger, an existential danger for Germany and for Europe."
159," The Federal Republic of Germany is in the midst of the most serious economic crisis and the Bundestag is simply not working and the agenda is being put on hold. Then Germany suffers from eroding security due to the drastic increase in foreign crime. That is also part of it. That is why we have long been calling for the borders to finally be closed. And nothing has ever been done in this area either. We are offering the CDU the opportunity to push through a motion to control our borders. And instead, the motions are wiped off the agenda or rejected. That also speaks volumes. And in our view, that reeks of voter fraud. This is a deeply anti-economic policy that is being pursued here. And Friedrich Merz will not be able to solve it with the Left, the Greens and the SPD. And that means voting for the original, the AfD. And we will go into the election campaign with that. And above all, we are once again calling for this. We want to work here. We want work to be done in the Bundestag. The sitting days must not be suspended here. Motions for reform and for Germany's recovery must be tabled and voted on here. And we are committed to this. We want work to be done in the Bundestag."
160," Everyone who makes a positive contribution to our society is welcome. Period. And that's how it should be kept. What people are complaining about, what they have just heard, is the loss of control and the loss of internal security because laws are not being observed and implemented, just as your colleague rightly said in these two cases. That is the problem. And that is why we need to finally have the political will. I hope that the next Federal Government will finally implement the law, especially on the issue of migration, so that we don't end up with a societal divide and this typical rallying cry."
161," We have just talked about the age cohort between 16 and 24. And this age cohort includes school pupils, first-year students and young professionals. And this group sees exactly what the situation is like in schools. We have the problem of migrant overstretch in large cities in western Germany. They have patchwork classes. In some cases, German is no longer spoken properly. Knowledge is no longer taught. They are very aware of that. Those are also the main points of criticism. Then the young people and young voters realize that their livelihoods are being destroyed here."
162," But we have a serious issue here that has been on our minds for days now. Because for the first time, an Islamist terrorist has killed a police officer in Germany. The courageous police officer Ruven L. lost his life while trying to protect citizens who wanted to exercise their fundamental right to freedom of expression. Our sincere condolences go out to Ruven L.'s relatives at this difficult time. We wish them much strength and Mr. Stürzenberger and the other victims of the brutal knife attack in Mannheim a speedy recovery. The AfD parliamentary group has requested a minute's silence from the Federal President for the police officer who was killed. This murder attack takes imported violence to a new level. It is frankly a disgrace that the political leaders in this country have nothing more than dry compulsory exercises and hackneyed phrases to offer. Federal President Steinmeier reaches a new peak of tastelessness when he takes the Mannheim knife murder as an opportunity to warn against, and I quote, the brutalization of political debate and the growing propensity for violence in our country. I have to say that an Islamist terrorist attack is not a political dispute. And it is also sheer mockery for the citizens who have to suffer from the loss of security in public spaces caused by mass migration. The same applies to Green Party leader Ricarda Lang's equation of the riots on Sylt with the attack in Mannheim. Both are equally a threat to freedom, claims the Green Party leader. This is an outrageous derailment and a mockery of the victims. However, words can neither bring back to life the young family man and police officer who was stabbed to death, nor can they assuage the grief of his relatives, nor can they give citizens back their freedom and security in public spaces. The murderous mass attack in Mannheim is a beacon. How many more people will die or be seriously injured? Action must finally be taken. What we need is a turnaround on migration in Germany. This requires naming the causes and those responsible. The criminal guilt for this murder and this bloodbath lies with the assassin. Political guilt and responsibility, on the other hand, lies with those politicians who for years and decades have pursued a policy of open borders and arbitrary mass immigration and have used all means at their disposal to defame and silence critics. It is this policy that has led to dangerous people like the Afghan murderer entering the country and not having to leave it. And who are responsible for the fact that our police officers have to take the rap for it, like Ruben L., who was murdered in Mannheim, and have to pay for it with their lives and their health. The figures speak for themselves. According to the police crime statistics in 2023, we are dealing with around 15,000 knife attacks A year. That's over 40 knife attacks per day. The figures are dramatic. And that's within our national borders. And I think it's nice and I have to say, I also think it's a bit of a shame to always have to read something like this in the Swiss press. One author, Philipp Gut, wrote an excellent article about this in Weltwoche, because it's always said here that we finally have to talk about deportation. And everyone's getting carried away. But he quite rightly writes here, and this is what the AfD has been saying for ten years, I quote, the real problem, to put it clearly, does not start with the deportation discussion, i.e. deportation, deportation discussion, about an Islamist stabber. That is the end of the story. The beginning is the mass migration that has gotten completely out of hand, the bogus asylum seekers, the tolerated, politically desired and promoted abuse of the asylum system on a scale of millions. One of the consequences of this is that tens of thousands of Syrians and Afghans are being naturalized. End quote. I'm glad to read something like this in a medium at all. I think it's a shame that I can't read anything like this in any German media. Because that's where dealing with the truth begins and also with the courage to finally address the problems here, that what is being done here is politically motivated and politically wanted, started by the Merkel-CDU, accelerated by the traffic light, million-fold asylum abuse of bogus asylum seekers within our national borders. That is all we are dealing with. And that is why we need a turnaround in migration through the pure application of law and order, which is all the AfD is calling for. It is simply not being done. And finally an end to the reign of injustice, which has been practiced millions of times over for years, by this really irresponsible do-gooderism, which has let millions of these people in, with exploding violent crime, according to police crime statistics. It really is irresponsible that criminal foreign nationals are being allowed into our country to commit these acts of violence. And it must be condemned. And a genuine change of policy must finally be initiated. And not with some empty words, which in my view are completely irresponsible."
163," The police crime statistics clearly show that foreign and juvenile crime in our country has gone through the roof. What is the cause of this? The cause is that we have allowed illegal migrants to flow into our country through open borders since 2015, and our state doesn't even know who they are, where they come from, how often they register in our welfare state and what they are actually doing here."
164," Why is that? That people no longer have confidence in our politicians, in the institutions of our country. And why so many people, especially young people, are afraid, afraid, this is not about worry, afraid for the future. That's why AfD on February 23."
165," I swear that I will devote my strength to the welfare of the German people, increase its benefits, avert harm from it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, conscientiously fulfill my duties and do justice to everyone. So help me God. So help me God."
166," We want the state to withdraw economically and we want it to withdraw socially. Above all, we want it to withdraw from our educational institutions with all its gender nonsense and diversity."
167," And that is why we say what needs to be done for Germany's recovery is obvious. We need to drastically reduce income, consumption and corporate taxes. We need to transform the citizen's income into an activating basic income. We need to eliminate the pull factors for illegal migration into our social systems. We can only do this by no longer paying cash benefits to foreign citizens and replacing them with benefits in kind. We need to reduce senseless government spending. Germany does not have a revenue problem. We have record revenues every year. Germany has a spending problem. The federal government cannot handle record tax revenues with care."
168," This is an example of why competencies should be reduced. We also consider the Building Energy Act to be intrusive. People should not be told which heating system to install, whether oil or gas. We have to stop with the prohibition policy and that has its origins in the European Union. And that's why we say that every nation state should decide for itself, where the elected parliaments sit. That is an example of competences."
169," A completely uncontrolled, unbridled immigration. People who came to us, back then we were told, were more valuable than gold. And today we see that the PKS has gone through the roof. We're talking about a total of 8,160 knife attacks. That's 23 knife attacks per day within the German border. It's really unbelievable what's happening here. And I would like to say that knife attacks like this are not part of our culture. It was unheard of before."
170," Dear friends, Sunday is the day. Germany has an election. If we make the AfD big enough, the firewall will collapse. Then Germany will finally get a change of policy. But for that to happen, we all have to go to the polls. That's why I have the following campaign for you. You go to the polls on Sunday, but not alone. Take two others with you. A good friend, your grandma or your oddball uncle. It doesn't matter. The main thing is that all three of you vote. For a change in our country. Together you three are friends for Germany. And for the best photos that you share on social media under the hashtag 3Freunde, we have one of these wonderful 25 signed Team Alice shirts as a thank you. So, join in, go to the polls, let's change our country. The three of us can do it."
171," Ten days have passed since the crushing election defeat in Saxony and Thuringia, which has degraded your Chancellor's party to a splinter party. You are still trying to convince yourself that voters are fleeing you in droves because they have not explained your policies well enough. The opposite is the case. The citizens have understood perfectly well that your policies mean the destruction of prosperity, deindustrialization, mass migration and the loss of internal security. You are the chancellor of decline, Mr. Scholz."
172," The AfD only relieves the rich? Fake news! Suppose your family income is 42,000 euros. The AfD increases your tax-free allowance. That means less income tax for you. A 20,000 euro exemption from pension insurance for each child. No more CO2 tax, no more broadcasting fees and no more property tax. Reduced social security contributions and consumer spending. With us, you will have around 7,400 euros more in your pocket each year. Time for Germany, time for change. Therefore, vote AfD on February 23. Support your AfD. Like and share this video."
173," We don't want dependencies. We want freedom. We want freedom of expression. We want economic freedom. We want freedom for companies. Entrepreneurial freedom. And above all, we want us all to be free again, for this country to be safe and for us to be able to live in freedom. That is what we stand for."
174," Welcome to the big AfD clique calendar. Today, Annalena is angry. Annalena, why are you looking so angry again? I don't want to break the news. Has someone been making 360-degree jokes again, Annalena? No, not this time. Did someone make fun of the Beacon of Hope? No, that's not it either. Yes, but Annalena, what's going on then? Weidel from the AfD called me Annalenchen. And intern. Well, where she's right, she's right. Alice, what should people do who wouldn't even employ Annalenchen as an intern somewhere? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode. What is it that we are looking for あ'm here?"
175," No problem drives people as much as having to watch our cities become increasingly unsafe, how no-go areas are emerging and how fear is spreading. Aschaffenburg, Magdeburg, Mannheim, Solingen and Munich. Sadly, the list goes on and on. The victims, honest citizens, men, women, increasingly often children and young people. The perpetrators are illegal immigrants, most of whom have a criminal record and have long been required to leave the country."
176," We see the slogan for our Time for Germany campaign behind us. Because we as the AfD think that it is finally time for our country, for the people who live here, who pay taxes here, for our children, for our grandchildren, to whom we owe exactly this, that we finally put the interests of our country at the center again, that our children, the grandchildren, have a perspective, a future perspective, can enjoy a great education, in schools where there is no gender stereotyping with gutters and gutters and anything else."
177," Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, woo! Secure your future! Vote AfD on 9.6., blue instead of colorful."
178," Dear Elin, thank you so much for your note. The alternative for Germany, the AfD, is indeed the one and only alternative for our country. Our last option, if you ask me. I wish you and President Donald Trump all the best for the upcoming tenure. And also, I wish you and all the American people Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."
179," Change of power in Syria. This was not even discussed today. From a German perspective, the change of power in Syria has two consequences. Firstly, Syrian war refugees who claim to have fled from the Assad regime, who are now celebrating the liberation of Syria in their tens of thousands on German streets and marching through Christmas markets and our pedestrian zones chanting Islamist battle songs, must return home immediately. New streams of refugees must be prevented from eclipsing the asylum influx of 2015 and once again bringing soldiers, Islamists and jihadists into the country undetected and ready to fight. What is needed, therefore, is an immediate halt to admissions."
180," Welcome to the big AfD clique calendar. Today Friedrich in left-hand traffic. Friedrich, what's going on in Thuringia? What's going on there? The CDU is the state premier. Yes, but the CDU is making a pact with the Left Party to make that possible. Do you think that's okay? Of course. Together with the BSW, the SPD and the Left Party, we form a totally stable government and prevent the AfD from governing. And why do you call it the 3 plus 1 model? Every time we put a new brick in the firewall, three bricks fall out somewhere else. And what should people do who don't agree with the CDU's betrayal of the voters? They should vote for the AfD. You can't get enough of the AfD's clique calendar. Subscribe to the channel now and never miss another episode."
181," We want Germany to get back to the top. And that is only possible with freedom. We can do that with research and development. And above all, we can do it with a great education for our young people sitting at the front. You are the future. You need a great education. And a top education also means that young people are enabled to get a top job, to be qualified. That's what we want as an alternative for Germany. And I can tell you, I can promise you, we will do away with all this gender madness and gender ideology. Everything will be closed up. Everything will be closed down. All gender chairs. We need math. We need German. We need foreign languages. We need intelligent people."
182," We want a change of direction in migration policy. We want secure borders. And we want illegal immigrants to be turned back at our borders. We want this loss of control to finally stop. And the people in this country want that too. And that's why we voted in favor of this motion, despite all of these points. For me, this is a complete Punch and Judy show. And you also saw that on Wednesday and, above all, on Friday. Interruptions to the session for four hours, but then a party night in Laschet's apartment beforehand. Black-Green more together with Ms. Baerbock. Black-Green, that's part of the election, that was a complete theater. And black-green is obviously being prepared there over beer and wine. That is complete voter deception."
183," We are the stable second strongest force and it was important to have agreed to these motions. After all, it was a motion to Wednesday and then a CDU bill. Incidentally, these are positions that the CDU had previously rejected for years. We have often put forward the same positions during our seven years in the Bundestag. But for us, the interests of the country come first, not party tactics. And I personally, I say quite clearly, because you just asked me about the possible chancellorship, I don't care who ultimately implements it. It doesn't have to be me. The main thing is that it is done. If a Union Chancellor does it, then let him do it. But Friedrich Merz will never be able to implement his election promises with a Green-Red coalition. And he has to be honest about that. Ultimately, he can only do this together with the AfD. And we'll see how that turns out on election night."
184," The AfD firmly believes that we must control our borders, make our borders secure and immediately turn illegal immigrants away from our borders. That is our program."
185," Wuh! Isn't that great? Actually, that's what we want. Actually, it's totally reasonable. It's normal. We are normal in our minds. We want to have a normal country in order. Because people just want normality. Not rocket science. They want normality. They want to go to work. They want to make a living with the money they earn. They want to start families. They want the best for their children and grandchildren. And that is normality. They want safe roads. They want safe public transportation. Young people want to be like I used to be. I'm so privileged to have been a teenager in the 90s. Wow, did we party. And that's what I want. So until dawn. On the bike. Back then, my father always told me to come home at 9 pm. I laughed my head off as a 15-year-old. 9 pm. No, we're completely safe. We girls. We rode our bikes to a party somewhere. And we cycled back in the middle of the night. Sometimes we didn't even hit the road. It didn't matter. But that was part of it. And it's exactly this freedom, dear friends, that I wish for you, for the next generation of young people, that they can party again. That they can go to a disco. Thank you very much."

187," Then the big farmers' protests. Brandenburg Gate, everything was closed. Middle-class people, entrepreneurs were there. Who wasn't there? The government bench was there. But I can tell you who was there. The AfD was there. I was there. I listened to it. That's why I voted AfD on February 23."
188, We'll be right back.
189," You think men can get pregnant? Don't vote AfD. You fancy war? Don't vote AfD. You want to eat insects? Don't vote AfD. You want to be censored online? Don't vote AfD. If not, then vote AfD. Because Germany is not just a place, it's our home. Laufstadtbund."
